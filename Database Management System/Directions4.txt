CSCE 4523: Database Management Systems
Fall 2015
Assignment Four
Due: Wednesday, November 18, 2015 at the beginning of class


Each task carries 6 points.  You may use Oracle notes part four to complete tasks 1-4 and part five for completing task 5.

Submit a hardcopy of the spool file containing the queries and their output in class.  Also, email only the queries to mswamina@email.uark.edu.  Make sure to add your name to your email.

First add an attribute named ckout_date (date type) to the Books table.  Then update each record that has a P_ID value present, to show a date when the corresponding patron had checked out that book.  Do NOT include these commands in the output files (query or spool file) that you submit for grading.

Make sure your queries run correctly irrespective of when they are run.

alter table books add ckout_date date;

update books set CKOUT_DATe = date '&date' where id = &id;
YYYY-MM-DD

DESCRIBE books;

1.  Find the names of patrons who have checked out books more than 10 days ago.  For each of those patrons, show his/her name and the month and date of check out with month spelled out completely.

select patrons.name, to_char(books.ckout_date, 'DD Month YYYY') as CKOUT_DATE from books inner join patrons on patrons.id=books.p_id where ckout_date < trunc(sysdate - 10);

2.  Show the total number of books checked out on weekends.

select count(*) as weekend_ckout from books where to_char(ckout_date, 'DY') in ('SAT', 'SUN');

3.  Show the total price of all books that were checked out in year 2014 but have not been returned yet.

select sum(price) from books where to_char(ckout_date, 'YYYY') in ('2014');

4.  For each book show its title and format. If the format is null for any book, print 'Format unknown' instead of displaying the null value.

select title, nvl(format, 'Format unknown') as format from books;

5.  Assume that books are due one week from the date they are checked out (for example, if a book was checked out on Nov. 1, 2015, it is due on Nov. 8, 2015).  After the due date, a late fee of $1 per day is charged.  Create a view to show the total late fee for each customer who is late in returning book(s).
Create the view before your create the spool file.  The view creation command should not be in your output files. Instead, do the followings to show the view definition.
Type the following 'SET' command only once after you log on to oracle.
    SQL> Set Long n   (replace n with an integer that is more than the maximum number of characters in the view definition)

    Then use the following 'SELECT' command to display the view definition.  The output of this command must appear in your output files.

    SQL> Select text from user_views where view_name = '????';
             Replace ???? with the view name in upper case.  Make sure to use quotes around the view name.

VIEW:
create view patron_fees as select patrons.name, to_char((trunc(sysdate) - trunc(ckout_date) - 7), '$0,000.00') as fee from books join patrons on patrons.id = books.p_id where to_number (trunc(sysdate) - trunc(books.ckout_date) - 7) > 0;

select * from patron_fees;
