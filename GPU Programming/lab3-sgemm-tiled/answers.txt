Some facts regarding the GTX480 (Fermi GPU)
1. Maximum number of threads per block: 1024
2. Warp size: 32
3. Maximum number of resident blocks per SM: 8
4. Maximum number of resident warps per SM: 48
5. Maximum number of resident threads per SM: 1536
6. Number of 32-bit register per SM: 32K=32768
7. Maximum amount of shared memory per SM: 48 KB = 49152 B

Some facts regarding the implementation
1. Block size: 16x16=256 threads
2. Resource requirement of each thread
   ptxas info    : Used 13 registers, 2104 bytes smem, 12 bytes cmem[1]
   
Calculation:
   32768/13 = 2520 threads
   49152/2104 = 23 blocks
   Therefore resource is not a constraint regarding the thread scheculing. 
   
   1536/256 = 6 blocks, which is under the limit.
   Therefore 1536*15=23040 threads can be scheduled simultaneously.
