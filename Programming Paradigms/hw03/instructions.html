<h1>Assignment 3</h1>

<p>For this assignment, you are asked to use your Charity class from assignment 2 and create a GUI which presents the user with dialog windows for
inputting information about a charity. Once all of the grant information has been entered, your program must display a window which contains a graphics panel on which is drawn
the charity's impact factor (which is a letter grade). You will need to read and learn about various GUI and <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/index.html?java/awt/Graphics.html">graphics</a> classes
provided by Java, and this is intended to give you experience in learning API's. There are also some helpful examples in the lecture slides.
(Specifically, the "GUI introduction" slides.)</p>

<p>To show you what is expected, an example solution for this assignment, "Assignment3.jar" has been posted on the course site. To run it from the command line, type:
</p><pre class="shell">java -jar Assignment3.jar
</pre>
<p></p>

<ol>
	<li>Make a new copy of the files from Assignment 2.</li><br><br>

	<li>In your Charity class, create a new function that will return just the impact factor (a letter grade) for the charity. You can make other modifications if you'd like, but make sure that it is still using ProgramGrant and AdminGrants objects.</li><br><br>

	<li>Create a new class named Assignment3, which will first use a series of dialogs to prompt the user for all of the necessary information for a charity:
		<ol>
			<li>Charity name</li>
			<li>Total amount of expenses</li>
			<li>The number of administrative grants</li>
			<li>If there were n administrative grants, prompt the user n times so he/she can enter the amount of each grant</li>
			<li>The amount for the research grant</li>
			<li>The number of people impacted by the research grant</li>
			<li>The impact factor (a letter grade) of the reserach grant</li>
			<li>The amount for the short term grant</li>
			<li>The number of people impacted by the short term grant</li>
			<li>The impact factor (a letter grade) of the short term grant</li>
		</ol>
	Your assignment should be run using the command "java Assignment3".
	</li><br><br>
	
	<li>When reading in the values for the amounts and number of people impacted, you should use Double.parseDouble and Integer.parseInt (google it for documentation about how it works) to get the double and integer values of the values entered by the user.  Note that Integer.parseInt and Double.parseDouble throws an exception if given something other than a valid number.  If such an exception occurs, you must catch the exception and display a dialog saying "Invalid data entered. Exiting." and then the program should immediately exit.</li><br><br>

	<li>A charity object should be created and all of that information should be used to calculate the charity's grade (just as in assignment 2).</li><br><br>

	<li>Finally, a JFrame object should be created which contains an instance of a panel class that you create (which should be in GradePanel.java and named GradePanel and will extend JPanel similar to the example DrawPanel class in section 4.14 of the book). The panel should display the grade for the charity. If the impact factor is "A", then draw an "A" using Graphics.drawLine. Make your letter "A" fill up the window, such that it touches the top side and the two bottom corners, even if the window is resized. If the impact factor is "B", "C", "D", or "F", then display the grade using some standard font.</li><br>

	<li>Submit a zip file in the usual manner. The zip file should contain exactly the source files AdminGrants.java, ProgramGrant.java, Charity.java, GradePanel.java, Assignment3.java, and a working build script (build.bat or build.bash) which compiles and executes your program.
		Do not submit any other files.<br><br></li>
		
<li>
Here is the rubric I will use when running your program.  Make sure your code meets each of these requirements.
<ol>
<li>-90%	Code does not compile</li>
<li>-20% Incorrect files contained in the zip file</li>
<li>-20% Build script does not correctly build and run your program</li>
<li>-10% (each) missing dialog box (20% total if it doesn't correctly loop for the required number of admin grants)</li>
<li>-5%  Incorrect text on dialog box (prompts for wrong information)</li>
<li>-10% If invalid value (i.e. non-integer) is entered, does not display "Invalid data entered. Exiting." then correctly exit</li>
<li>-40% Missing panel with charity's grade </li>
<li>-30% Final grade is displayed in a dialog rather than drawn on a panel</li>
<li>-20% "A" is not drawn with lines</li>
<li>-10% "A" does not expand or shrink to correctly fill resized window</li>
<li>-10% "B","C", or "D" grade is not written with font</li>
<li>-10% (each) Incorrect charity grade</li>
</ol>
</li>

</ol>
