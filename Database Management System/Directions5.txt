You may refer to PL/SQL part of oracle notes for help with this assignment.

Write a PL/SQL procedure to update a record in the books table when a book is checked out by a patron.  The procedure must perform the following tasks.

1.  The procedure accepts a book id and a patron id from user.

2.  It then performs the following checks:
(a) There exists a record for the corresponding book in the books table,
(b) The book has not been already checked out, and
(c) The patron id also exists in patrons table.

 If any of these conditions fail, the procedure prints an appropriate message (there must be three different messages, one for each condition) and quits.

3.      If all of the above conditions are satisfied, the procedure updates the corresponding record in the books table by adding the patron id and ckout_date, and prints an appropriate message.  In this case, the value of the ckout_date column for the record being updated should be the same as the system date.

Save the procedure in a file named as ABC.sql, replacing 'ABC' with your last name.  Email the file AS AN ATTACHMENT to mswamina@email.uark.edu with the subject line "DBMS Class Assignment Five".

Generate a spool file showing the procedure code and the output of each of the failed cases in task 2 and of a successful case (task 3). Turn in a hard-copy of the spool file in class.
