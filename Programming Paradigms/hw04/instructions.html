<h1>Assignment 4</h1>


<ol>
	<li>Download the "atoms.zip" starter kit. Extract, build and run it ("java Controller"). You should see a sodium atom. When you click somewhere in the window, the atom slowly travels to the spot where you clicked.<br><br>
		If you get an exception saying it cannot find the file "Sodium.png", make sures
		you know what directory you are executing within. Here is a command to print the current working directory:
<pre class="code">System.out.println("cwd=" + System.getProperty("user.dir"));
</pre>
		You should make sure that the image file is in that directory..
		</li><br><br>

	<li>This code uses a "Model-View-Controller" architecture. This is a good general structure for many programs. Specifically, it is
	usually a good idea to keep your views and your models well-separated. Examine the code and see how much of it you can understand.</li><br><br>

	<li>Modify the Model class to store an ArrayList of Sodiums. Make Model.update call Sodium.update for each Sodium in the ArrayList. To test it, put two or three sodium atoms in the ArrayList, each starting in different
	locations. When you click (which causes "setDestination" to be called), make all of the atoms head for the same destination. Get this much working before you proceed.</li><br><br>
		
	<li>Make the dest_x and dest_y variables for the Sodium class into static variables, since all Sodium object instances will share the same destination.  Also, make the setDest function static and make sure that it is correctly called from Model.</li><br><br>

	<li>Make an <b>abstract</b> class called "Atom", which stores an (x,y) position, and a reference to an Image. The constructor of your Atom class should take 2
	int parameters (to specify the initial x and y position), and a string which is the name of the file to load the image from, and it should load the image (instead of the Sodium class loading the image).  It will need a getter function for the image.  Make an abstract method in your Atom class named "public void update(Graphics g)".  This function should have no body.  The purpose of this is to ensure that any class which inherits from this class implements an update function.</li><br><br>
		
	<li>Make your Sodium class inherit from Atom. (The (x,y) position and image reference should no longer be stored in the Sodium class, but in the Atom class.) Make the Sodium constructor call the Atom constructor to correctly load the image.  (Note that your Sodium constructor will now also take an x and y value to pass along to the Atom constructor.)  Modify the ArrayList in your Model to be an ArrayList&lt;Atom&gt; instead of ArrayList&lt;Sodium&gt;. Get this much working before you proceed.</li><br><br>

	<li>In the Model class, change "setDestination" to use a java.security.SecureRandom object to generate a random x coordinate between 0 and the value of the width parameter, and a random y coordinate between 0 and the height parameter.  It should then create a new Sodium at the point (x,y) and add it to the ArrayList of Atoms.  No longer create any Sodiums initially, but only have them created when the user clicks the mouse (i.e. when "setDestination" is called).</li><br><br>

	<li>Make another class called "Chlorine", which also extends Atom. (A chlorine image is included in the starter kit for convenience.) Don't pick random values for its initial position--instead, Chlorine will always start where you click.  The constructor should also take two int parameters for the width and the height of the window.  It should generate two numbers between -6 and 6, xSlope and ySlope, and each time the Chlorine moves it should move by a distance of xSlope to the right (or left if that value is negative) and ySlope down (or up if that value is negative).  If a Chlorine reaches the edge of the screen in one direction, it should reappear on the other side.  (For example, if it is moving left and its x coordinate becomes negative, it should be set to the x coordinate of the right side of the screen, which is the width.)</li><br><br>

	<li>Start your program with no Atoms on the screen. Each time you single-click the mouse, add a new Atom to the model. Alternate between Sodiums and Chlorines. The first time, add a Sodium. The second time, add a Chlorine. The third time, add a Sodium, and so forth.  Each time that a Sodium is added, it appears in a random location and the point of the click becomes the new destination for all Sodium, and each time a Chlorine is added the point of the click is the location at which it is added.  You can download and run Assignment4-example-solution.jar for an example.</li><br><br>

	<li>Your model.update method should iterate over the Atoms in the ArrayList. Note that when you call Atom.update(), it will actually call Sodium.update() or Chlorine.update(), depending on the type of Atom. This is polymorphism.</li><br><br>

	<li>Submit a zip file in the usual manner. The zip file should contain your source files, image files, and a working build script, and no other files.  Your build script should build and run your program.  The only included source files should be: Controller.java, Model.java, Chlorine.java, Atom.java, Sodium.java, and View.java.  The image files should be: Sodium.png and Chlorine.png. Do not submit any other files (including .class files). Test your zip file before you submit it by extracting into a separate folder and running your build script. Remember that your classes should not be in a package (other than the default package, which requires no "package" statement in your source).</li><br><br>

	<li>
	Here is the rubric I will use when running your program.  Make sure your code meets each of these requirements. <br><br>
	<ol>
	<li>-90% Code does not compile</li>
	<li>-20% Incorrect files contained in the zip file</li>
	<li>-20% Build script does not correctly build and run your program</li>
	<li>-20% A new Sodium or Chlorine does not appear each time you click, alternating each time you click</li>
	<li>-15% Sodiums don't start at random locations and converge to the point of click</li>
	<li>-15% Chlorines don't start where you click, then travel in random slopes (in the specified range)</li>
	<li>-10% Chlorines don't wrap around from one edge of the screen to another</li>
	<li>-10% The ArrayList in the Model class doesn't use generics. (That is, it doesn't use an ArrayList&lt;Atom&gt;, instead of just an ArrayList)</li>
	<li>-10% The code doesn't use polymorphism. (That is, the Model.update() method doesn't call an abstract Atom.update() method.)</li>
	</ol>
	</li>
