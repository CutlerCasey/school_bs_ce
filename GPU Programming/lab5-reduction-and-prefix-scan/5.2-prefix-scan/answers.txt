Describe how you handled arrays not a power of two in size and all performance-enhancing optimizations you added.

Answer: The provided solution can handle arrays of arbitrary size. For the size that is not the multiple of 1024, it pads it with zero at the tail.
This implementation uses the work-efficient approach. Please refer to the document for optimization techniques used in this approach.
