Code done while obtaining my Bachelor of Science in Computer Engineering
-------

- Computer Networks
	- The class was more dedicated to learning about how Networks ran
	- Code is first attempt at Python and it does not work due to White Space errors
- Cryptography
	- This class was Masters or Higher level class for both Math and Computer Science Majors
	- I used C++, C and Java
		- Ended with Java due to its natvie BIG_INT
		- While taking the class I went throuh all three languages just to try it
	- Things I learned from the class
		- [Big O Notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_O_notation "Big O Notation"), since I did not take a class like Algorthims
		- Ways to find Relatively Large Primes in an efficient way
		- [Pohlig–Hellman algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pohlig%E2%80%93Hellman_algorithm "Pohlig–Hellman algorithm")
		- [Elliptic-curve Diffie–Hellman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic-curve_Diffie%E2%80%93Hellman "Elliptic-curve Diffie–Hellman")
		- A whole bunch of other Cryptographic Algorthims
- Database Management System
	- Basically a class where you used select statements to query data in a DB
	- This taught me that Normal DBs and Access are quite different
		- Had not used Access in almost six years when taking this class
- Operating Systems
	- A Bash shell that was written in C that worked inside the schools Linux system
	- Actually started on an Advance class portion of the code to help out some of them
		- This code is not the advanced version, due to lack on time constraints I could not finish it
	- Differences
		- Multiple Pipe and Redirects instead of just one
		- Needed to work with a few more commands that the Basic class did not have to do
- Programming Paradigms
	- Third coding class and first to be in multiple languages
		- First time ever touching Java or PHP
- System Synthesis & Modeling
	- A four bit RISC Micro Processor using ModelSim and Verilog

Most likely my favorite classes were Operating Systems, System Synthesis & Modeling, and Cryptoghrapy when it comes to the coding portion. This is partly due to that they for the most part had goals for the code and not just kind of tacked on to the course. I did take more Computer Engineering Courses, but most of them did not have code at all. Database is not code.
